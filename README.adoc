= Nickel Config Reporter
:toc: preamble
:toclevels: 3
:icons: font
:source-highlighter: rouge

A configuration reporting and validation utility built with the Nickel configuration language.

== Project Status

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Repository Project Specification** — Core implementation will be uploaded shortly.

Currently, only infrastructure scaffolding is in place:

* Multi-platform SCM mirroring (GitHub → GitLab, Codeberg, Bitbucket)
* Instant-sync propagation workflow
* Security policies and development guidelines
====

== Planned Features

* **Configuration Validation** — Validate configs against Nickel contracts
* **Schema Reporting** — Generate human-readable reports from Nickel schemas
* **Diff Detection** — Compare configuration versions and report changes
* **Multi-Format Export** — Output reports in JSON, YAML, TOML, or plain text
* **CI/CD Integration** — Validate configs in pipelines before deployment

== Technology Stack

Per the link:.claude/CLAUDE.md[Hyperpolymath Language Policy]:

| Component | Technology

| Core Logic
| Rust (CLI, validation engine)

| Configuration
| Nickel (.ncl files)

| Scripting/Glue
| Deno + ReScript (if web UI needed)

| Package Management
| Guix (primary), Nix (fallback)

== Repository Infrastructure

=== Multi-Platform Mirroring

This repository automatically mirrors to multiple Git forges:

[source]
----
GitHub (primary)
    ├── GitLab
    ├── Codeberg
    └── Bitbucket
----

Mirroring is controlled via repository variables:

* `GITLAB_MIRROR_ENABLED`
* `CODEBERG_MIRROR_ENABLED`
* `BITBUCKET_MIRROR_ENABLED`

=== Instant Sync

On push to `main`/`master` or release publication, the repository triggers propagation to all configured forges via the `.git-private-farm` dispatch mechanism.

== Getting Started

[NOTE]
====
Build and usage instructions will be added once core implementation is uploaded.
====

=== Prerequisites (Planned)

* Rust toolchain (stable)
* Nickel CLI
* Guix or Nix (for reproducible builds)

=== Installation (Planned)

[source,bash]
----
# Via Guix
guix install nickel-config-reporter

# Via Cargo
cargo install nickel-config-reporter

# From source
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/nickel-config-reporter.git
cd nickel-config-reporter
cargo build --release

== Contributing

Contributions welcome once core implementation is in place.

All contributions must follow:

1. Hyperpolymath language policy (no TypeScript, Node.js, Go, etc.)
